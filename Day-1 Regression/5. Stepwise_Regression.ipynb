    "# Stepwise Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Stepwise regression is the step-by-step iterative construction of a regression model that involves the selection of independent variables to be used in a final model. It involves adding or removing potential explanatory variables in succession and testing for statistical significance after each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types\n",
    "\n",
    "* Forward selection begins with no variables in the model, tests each variable as it is added to the model, then keeps those that are deemed most statistically significantâ€”repeating the process until the results are optimal.\n",
    "* Backward elimination starts with a set of independent variables, deleting one at a time, then testing to see if the removed variable is statistically significant.\n",
    "* Bidirectional elimination is a combination of the first two methods that test which variables should be included or excluded."
